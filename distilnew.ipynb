            "Doctor: Hello, what brings you in today?\n",
            "Patient: Hi, my 21-month-old son has been experiencing weakness in his lower extremities and lumbar pain after a mild upper respiratory tract infection.\n",
            "Doctor: I see. Did you consult any medical professional for this issue?\n",
            "Patient: Yes, we took him to the pediatric emergency department. They did a hip ultrasound, but they didn't find any joint effusion. They dismissed it as transient hips arthritis and treated him with anti-inflammatory therapy.\n",
            "Doctor: Did the therapy help with his condition?\n",
            "Patient: Unfortunately, no. His pain got worse, and now he's unable to walk. That's why we came back here.\n",
            "Doctor: We should definitely investigate further. We'll start by admitting him to the hospital. We'll need to perform a spine radiograph and an MRI to determine what's causing his condition. \n",
            "Patient: Okay, thank you.\n",
            "[After the tests]\n",
            "Doctor: I've reviewed the test results. The spine radiograph showed a slight reduction in the thickness of the L5 soma. The MRI revealed increased T1 post-enhancement signals in the L4-L5 anulus, the opposite end-plates of L4 and L5, the adjacent soft tissues, and the osteolytic area of the L5 pedicle. These findings suggest that your son has Spondylodiscitis with associated osteomyelitis.\n",
            "Patient: Oh no! What about his blood tests?\n",
            "Doctor: The blood tests showed an increase in the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (77 mm/h) and C-reactive protein (2.5 mg/dL) in the l4-l5. This suggests that he has spondyloblastoma, which is a degenerative disease that is caused by inflammation of the bone.\n",
            "Dr: I'm not sure if this is the case, but I think it's important to note that this is not the first time that a patient has been diagnosed with a spinal cord injury. In the past, spinal cord injuries have been associated with an increased risk of spinal cord damage.\n",
            "In the last few years, there has been a decrease in the number of spinal cords in the U.S. and in the United Kingdom. This is due in part to the fact that there is no evidence that spinal cords have been affected by spinal cords injury.\n",
            "The U.K. is the only country in the world that does not have spinal cords. In fact, it is the second most populous nation in the developed world. The United Kingdom has a population of more than 1,\n",

            "S: The patient, a 21-month-old male, presented with weakness in his lower extremities and lumbar pain following a mild upper respiratory tract infection. Initial treatment with anti-inflammatory therapy for suspected transient hips arthritis was ineffective, leading to worsening pain and inability to walk.\n",
            "O: Hip ultrasound showed no joint effusion. Spine radiograph revealed slight reduction in the thickness of the L5 soma. MRI indicated increased T1 post-enhancement signals in the L4-L5 anulus, opposite end-plates of L4 and L5, adjacent soft tissues, and osteolytic area of the L5 pedicle. Blood tests showed elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (77 mm/h) and C-reactive protein (2.17 mg/dL), with normal white blood cell count, procalcitonin serum concentration, and Quantiferon TB-gold test. After 3 weeks of therapy, the patient developed leukopenia with severe neutropenia (white blood cell count at 5410/mm3).\n",
            "A: Primary diagnosis is Spondylodiscitis with associated osteomyelitis. Differential diagnosis initially included transient hips arthritis. Complications include leukopenia with severe neutropenia.\n",
            "P: Initiated broad-spectrum intravenous therapy with meropenem (100 mg/kg/day in three doses) and vancomycin (40 mg/kg/day in three doses), alongside continuation of anti-inflammatory treatment for the first week. Plan to closely monitor the patient's progress and adjust treatment as necessary, with specific attention to the recent development of leukopenia with severe neutropenia. Regular follow-ups and blood tests are scheduled to monitor the condition and treatment efficacy.\n",
