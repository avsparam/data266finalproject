When you were admitted to the hospital, we started a continuous intravenous infusion of fentanyl at 1200 μg/day to control your abdominal pain. Over the course of 10 days, we increased the dose according to your pain intensity, reaching 2400 μg/day (MED 240 mg/day). How has your pain been since then?\n",

We have gradually reduced the continuous fentanyl infusion, and it was discontinued after reaching 240 μg/day (10% of the maximum dose). However, you mentioned experiencing nausea/vomiting, elevated blood pressure, and restlessness 12 hours after discontinuation. Is that correct?\n",
            "Patient: Yes, that's right. It was pretty uncomfortable.\n",
            "Doctor: I apologize for the discomfort. To alleviate these symptoms, we resumed the continuous intravenous fentanyl infusion at 240 μg/day, and the symptoms disappeared. However, restlessness occurred each time the dose was reduced, so we decided to initiate a transdermal fentanyl patch to taper the opioid more slowly. How has that been working for you?\n",

            "Doctor: I also see in your file that you have a past history of infrarenal aortic stenosis, which was diagnosed based on a computed tomographic angiogram. This angiogram was done to investigate your persistent hypertension and intermittent claudication postpartum. It showed 75% stenosis of the infrarenal aorta with hypertrophied internal mammary and epigastric arteries. Is that correct?\n",
            "Patient: Yes, that's right.\n",

            "Doctor: Thank you for the information. The differential diagnoses for your major finding of significant infrarenal aortic stenosis include congenital abdominal coarctation, Takayasu's arteritis, fibromuscular dysplasia, aortic neurofibromatosis, aortic tuberculosis, and radiation aortitis. In your case, the presence of a well-developed collateral vasculature suggests a chronic aortopathy.\n",
            "Patient: Okay, so what does that mean?\n",
            "Doctor: Since you don't have any clinical history or signs of neurofibromatosis, tuberculosis, or radiation exposure, and there is little evidence of active inflammation, the diagnosis could be chronic abdominal aortopathy from congenital abdominal aortic coarctation, fibromuscular dysplasia, or an inactive form of Takayasu's arteritis. We will need to continue monitoring your condition and possibly adjust your treatment plan accordingly.\n",

            "Doctor: Okay, let's take a look at some imaging tests. *Examines radiographs and MRI* The simple radiographs showed no abnormal findings, but the MRI revealed a soft tissue mass located near your knee joint. It has an ill-defined border and high signal intensities on both T1- and T2-weighted images. On fat-suppressed images, it has low signal intensity, and there's no contrast enhancement in contrast imaging. Your blood examination also showed no abnormal findings.\n",
            "Patient: Oh, that doesn't sound good. What do you suggest I do?\n",

It looked like fat and had an ill-defined border. We removed it piece by piece through a resection. Histologically, it was mainly composed of connective tissue and fatty tissue, but we didn't find any signs of lipoma, lipoma arborescens, or pigmented villonodular synovitis.\n",

            "Doctor: Hmm, it sounds like you may have a positive Murphy's sign. You were referred to our department for further evaluation and possible surgical treatment. We performed a Computed Tomography (CT) scan without contrast media, which revealed a gallstone in your thickened gallbladder wall. There was also a slight increase in the CT value due to surrounding panniculitis, as shown in Fig.\n",

            "Patient: Okay, so what's the next step for treatment?\n",
            "Doctor: We performed a laparoscopic cholecystectomy to address the issue. During the procedure, we placed four ports: a 12-mm camera port in the umbilical area, a 12-mm port in the epigastric area, a 5-mm port in the right subcostal area, and a 5-mm port at the right lateral abdomen.\n",
            "Patient: How did the surgery go?\n",
            "Doctor: Due to the inflammatory fibrotic adhesion in Calot's triangle, the aberrant right hepatic duct (ARHD) was excessively exposed. We used a fundus-first technique to confirm the ARHD after exposing the inner layer of the subserosal layer at the dorsal and ventral side of Calot's triangle. We confirmed that the ARHD drained into the cystic duct.\n",
            "Patient: Was there any need to preserve the ARHD?\n",

            "Patient: So, what was done during the surgery?\n",
            "Doctor: We performed intraoperative cholangiography from the cystic duct in the periphery, which revealed that the ARHD was not confluent with the major right branch of the intrahepatic bile duct and drained a narrow area. We decided to remove the excessively exposed ARHD.\n",
            "Patient: How was the ARHD removed?\n",

            "Patient: Okay, so what happens if the CT scan confirms the diagnosis?\n",
            "Doctor: If the diagnosis is confirmed, we'll need to surgically remove the gland. The surgery will involve making a Risdon incision about 3 to 4 cm below your mandible. We'll identify and protect your marginal mandibular nerve and remove the submandibular gland from the mylohyoid muscle. Then, we'll divide and ligate the submandibular duct to remove the gland along with the calculi. In your case, we found a 7 mm spherical formation.\n",

            "Doctor: The largest metastatic focus measured 0.6 cm and was comprised of tumor cell nests arranged along the periphery of a sclerotic stroma with cords of tumor cells showing retraction artifact. These areas resembled the dense amyloid-type stroma often seen in medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC). Additionally, we observed numerous areas of rimming of the thyroid follicles by the tumor cells, which mimicked the appearance of C cell hyperplasia (CCH).\n",

            "Doctor: That's correct. At that time, you were still morbidly obese and had been lost to follow-up. We performed an emergency surgical hernia repair, which included resection of the necrotic transverse colon, and created a loop ileostomy. One year later, you presented with a LAGB port-site infection. Do you remember what we did during that time?\n",
            "Patient: Yes, you removed the port and sutured the tubing to my abdominal wall.\n",
            "Doctor: Exactly. During both admissions, we observed the LAGB tubing in a stable position adjacent to the transverse colon on the CT scans, with no concerns for penetration. Six months after the port-site infection, we elected to reverse the ileostomy. However, there were complications in the early post-operative period. Can you tell me about those symptoms?\n",

Given this finding, we ordered an upper gastrointestinal (UGI) evaluation. During the early phase, no leak was observed, partly due to the slow passage of 30 ml oral non-ionic contrast.\n",
            "Patient: Oh, I see.\n",
            "Doctor: Some residual contrast from the outside hospital CT was present in the transverse and descending colon. Only after delayed imaging and administration of additional non-ionic contrast were we able to determine the situation more accurately.\n",

We also performed a lumbar puncture to check your cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). It demonstrated raised intracranial pressure of 26 cm H2O, elevated cell count of 260 cells/mm3 with 90% lymphocyte predominance, low glucose of 1.9 mmol/L, and raised protein at 1.15 g/L.\n",

Your blood cryptococcal antigen was also detected at a titre of 1:1280. Importantly, your human immunodeficiency virus testing came back negative.\n",
            "Patient: So, it's an infection, not a tumor?\n",
            "Doctor: That's correct. We performed a bronchoscopy to further evaluate the right upper lobe mass. The bronchoalveolar lavage showed thick-walled fungal yeast forms with narrow-based budding, consistent with Cryptococcus yeasts. These were highlighted by mucicarmine special stain.

Based on your vitals, you're currently febrile with a temperature of 102.0°F, hypotensive with a blood pressure of 82/56 mmHg, and tachycardic at a rate of 149 bpm. Your physical exam showed cervical lymphadenopathy as well. We have also conducted some laboratory tests.\n",
            "Patient: What did the tests show?\n",
            "Doctor: Your lab results revealed segmented neutrophil predominant leukocytosis, elevated levels of troponin (2.45 ng/ml), BNP (457.2 pg/ml), and d-dimer (6.72 µg/ml). Your Electrocardiogram (EKG) demonstrated sinus tachycardia with possible left atrial enlargement. Based on these findings, we have initiated Vasopressor support and an unfractionated heparin drip, and you have been admitted to the intensive care unit for further management.\n",

            "Patient: What's the next step in my treatment?\n",
            "Doctor: We performed a right heart catheterization, which demonstrated elevated wedge pressure, pulmonary arterial pressure, and right ventricular pressure. These findings are consistent with acute left ventricular failure and secondary pulmonary arterial hypertension. With a presumptive diagnosis, we will continue to monitor your condition and adjust your treatment accordingly.\n",

I see that you first presented to us back in September 2016, when you were diagnosed with pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonitis (PJP) on transbronchial lung biopsy. You were successfully treated with co-trimoxazole and prednisolone. The biopsy didn't reveal any CMV inclusion bodies at that time.

You underwent a fertility-sparing staging surgery which included a unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, unilateral pelvic and para-aortic lymph node dissection, omentectomy, and cul-de-sac tumor excision. Then, you received chemotherapy with 4 cycles of BEP, which is bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin. Is that right?\n",

Now, during your follow-up, disease recurrence was suspected due to tumor marker elevation again (AFP: 118.82 ng/mL, CA 125: 58.82 U/mL) and pelvic cystic lesions with ascites on abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan. That's why you were referred to us. Have you noticed any new symptoms lately?\n",

The teratoma component is made up of squamous epithelium, intestinal-type epithelium, respiratory epithelium, mesenchymal tissue, and neuroglial tissue. The immature element is found focally and is composed of fetal-type epithelium and mesenchymal tissue. \n",

            "Patient: How did the surgery go?\n",
            "Doctor: Intraoperatively, we found a well-defined cystic lesion measuring around 3x3 cm2 in the right buccal space. The cyst contained thick mucinous fluid. We sent the specimen for histopathological examination, and the findings were consistent with an oncocytoma.\n",
            "Patient: Oh, I see.\n",
            "Doctor: After the surgery, we kept you on intravenous antibiotics. The postoperative period was uneventful, with mild soft tissue swelling over the operated area without any collections. You were then discharged on the 7th postoperative day.\n",
            "Patient: That's good to hear. How has my recovery been going?\n",
            "Doctor: On your follow-up visit 1 week later, the swelling over the buccal region had subsided, and the intraoral surgical wound had healed. We followed up again after 3 months, and there were no signs of recurrence or disease progression.\n",
            "Patient: That's a relief. Thank you for taking care of me, doctor.\n",

            "Patient: It's been happening for the past 5 months. The pain usually comes 15-30 minutes after every meal, but it's less severe and goes away on its own.\n",
            "Doctor: Okay, let's review your test results. Your full blood count, serum biochemistry values, and C-reactive protein level are within normal ranges. Your arterial gas analysis is also normal. However, your abdominal plain radiography showed free air between the liver and diaphragm, and PI (Fig.). Additionally, abdominal computed tomography showed severe calcification of the SMA origin; SMA peripheral flow was reserved (Fig.). Computed tomography (CT) revealed bubble-like intramural gas of the small bowel with the contrasted wall pneumoperitoneum (Fig.).\n",
            "Patient: Hmm, that sounds concerning. What does that all mean?\n",
            "Doctor: Since you don't have peritonitis, we decided to take a conservative approach. We managed your condition in the intensive care unit due to potential risks of acute mesenteric ischemia from mesenteric artery occlusion or non-occlusive mesenteric ischemia. You were treated for bowel obstruction, which included fasting and intravenous fluid administration. You also received heparin infusion to prevent SMA occlusion and maintain collateral flow.\n",
            "Patient: Yes, I remember that. I actually felt some relief from my abdominal pain during my stay in the ICU.\n",
            "Doctor: That's good to hear. Seven days after admission, your abdominal plain radiography showed improvement in PI and pneumoperitoneum. So, we allowed you to start drinking fluids. Did you experience any pain after consuming fluids?\n",
            "Patient: No, I didn't have any recurrent abdominal pain after drinking fluids.\n",
            "Doctor: Great. Since there was no pain, we allowed you to eat solid food as well. Now, we had planned an angiography to further investigate and potentially relieve your postprandial abdominal pain. The findings showed severe stenosis of the SMA origin with calcification, and the SMA had replaced the common hepatic artery (Fig., ). We performed ET, namely stenting to the SMA and common hepatic artery.\n",
            "Patient: How was the procedure done?\n",
            "Doctor: We engaged the SMA trunk with a 6F Parent Plus 60 guiding catheter (Medikit, Tokyo, Japan) from your left brachial artery. Initially, we infused 8000 units of heparin, and added additional heparin to keep your activated whole blood clotting time over 200 seconds.\n",
            "Patient: I see. So, what's next for me?\n",
            "Doctor: Now that the procedure is done, we will continue to monitor your condition closely. It's essential to maintain a proper diet and follow up with your appointments regularly. If you notice any recurrence of abdominal pain or any new symptoms, please contact us immediately.\n",

            "Patient: Yeah, I've been feeling really tired and confused lately. I also noticed some unexplained weight loss.\n",
            "Doctor: Your physical exam didn't show any signs of volume overload or depletion, which is good. However, your workup revealed a sodium level of 126 mmol/l without other electrolyte abnormalities, serum osmolality of 260 mOsm/kg, serum uric acid level of 2.0 mg/dl, normal cortisol, normal TSH, urine sodium of 45 mmol/l, and urine osmolality of 274 mOsm/kg. These findings are consistent with a condition called SIADH. You were taking Citalopram, which we thought might have been the cause, so we stopped it. However, your hyponatremia persisted, so we did some more tests, especially considering your extensive smoking history.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, I've been a smoker for a long time.\n",
            "Doctor: We performed a computed tomography (CT) scan, which showed a right hilar mass with metastasis to the liver, right femur, and ribs. A biopsy revealed that you have small cell lung cancer (SCLC).\n",
            "Patient: Oh no, that's terrible.\n",
            "Doctor: I understand this is difficult news, but it's important to address it. I've noticed that you've continued to smoke cigarettes even after the SCLC diagnosis. About two weeks later, you were admitted for acute hypoxic and hypercapnic respiratory failure due to postobstructive pneumonia, COPD exacerbation, and secondary pneumothorax. We managed these issues, and there was some improvement in your respiratory status.\n",
            "Patient: Yeah, my breathing got a bit better after that.\n",
            "Doctor: However, your PaCO2 and serum bicarbonate levels began to increase, with the bicarbonate level approaching up to 45 mEq/dl. This was associated with refractory hypokalemia and uncontrolled hypertension. We noticed metabolic alkalosis, which was chloride resistant, as your urine chloride was >20 mEq/dl. Your hyponatremia responded moderately to fluid restriction and gradually normalized after the onset of metabolic alkalosis.\n",
            "Patient: So, what does that mean for me?\n",
            "Doctor: Well, with uncontrolled hypertension and the presence of chloride-resistant metabolic alkalosis and hypokalemia, we decided to conduct a workup for hyperaldosteronism. Your serum aldosterone and plasma renin activity were within normal limits, so we proceeded with a high-dose dexamethasone suppression test.\n",
            "Patient: What did the test show?\n",
            "Doctor: The test revealed elevations of ACTH (319 pg/ml) and cortisol (131.5 μg/dl), consistent with ACTH-dependent hypercortisolism and a condition called SAME, which is caused by an ectopic nonsuppressible source of ACTH. Furthermore, you've experienced significant weight loss of 28 pounds after your SCLC diagnosis and profound muscle wasting.\n",
            "Patient: That's a lot to take in. What's next for me?\n",
            "Doctor: We'll be working closely with you to create a personalized treatment plan to address both your SCLC and the metabolic issues. It's important to follow up with your medical team and monitor your symptoms. We'll do our best to support you through this process.\n",

            "Patient: Yes, I attended 3 antenatal visits at a health center. They documented my fundal height at each visit and gave me routine care. I had occasional painful fetal kicks, but I was otherwise well throughout the antenatal period.\n",
            "Doctor: It's good that you had regular visits. When did you start to notice reduced fetal movements?\n",
            "Patient: Hmm, about three days before I got admitted to your service, I noticed the reduced movements, so I consulted at the health center, and they said it was fetal demise.\n",
            "Doctor: I see. When you were admitted to our unit, we checked your vital parameters and found them to be stable. There was no abdominal tenderness, and your fundal height was 32cm. Fetal parts were not easily palpable, and we couldn't perceive fetal heart tones. Also, there were no signs of per vaginal bleeding. Your cervix was long, posterior, firm, and closed. We requested an emergency ultrasound scan, which confirmed the fetal demise and showed gross cranial deformation. However, it didn't diagnose an intra-abdominal location.\n",
            "Patient: That's really sad. So, what did you do next?\n",
            "Doctor: We started cervical ripening with 50µg of misoprostol vaginally every 6 hours. After 4 applications, your cervix remained unchanged. So, we decided to proceed with operative delivery to avoid failed induction and reduce the risk of disseminated intravascular coagulation.\n",
            "Patient: What did you find during the operation?\n",
            "Doctor: The intraoperative findings showed a third-degree macerated female fetus floating freely in the peritoneal cavity, weighing 2650g with a tight cord round her neck, and there was no amniotic sac. The uterus was about 14 weeks, and the fallopian tubes and ovaries were normal. The placenta was implanted on the ascending colon and mesocolon. We decided to leave the placenta in place as there were no intraoperative complications encountered.\n",
            "Patient: What treatment did I receive after the operation?\n",
            "Doctor: Postoperatively, you were placed on ampicillin, gentamycin, and metronidazole parenterally for five days to prevent infection. Additionally, you received 50mg of methotrexate every other day for 4 doses, along with 5mg of folinic acid each day following the methotrexate treatment.\n",

            "[Doctor takes X-rays]\n",
            "Doctor: Your X-rays show that the fracture is highly comminuted, meaning there are many small, intra-articular fragments. To restore overall radiographic parameters and stability, we'll use ligamentotaxis with a 2.4/2.7 mm Synthes dorsal bridge plate. We'll also add percutaneously placed K wires for extra stabilization of the radial styloid and lunate facet.\n",
            "Patient: Okay, so what does that involve?\n",
            "Doctor: We'll make two incisions, one over the index metacarpal and one over the radial shaft. We won't open the third dorsal extensor compartment at the level of the wrist, which is a contrast to others' techniques. The plate will be placed deep to the extensor tendons in the proximal, radial shaft incision. We'll leave the K wire ends outside the skin to allow staged hardware removal without multiple trips to the operating room.\n",
            "Patient: Got it. And after the procedure, what will my recovery look like?\n",
            "Doctor: Postoperative X-rays will show improved radial inclination and articular congruity, with some residual slight dorsal tilt. You'll return for regular follow-up visits, and we'll remove the two K wires in the clinic about 4 weeks after surgery. At that point, you should be able to extend your thumb at the interphalangeal joint.\n",
            "Patient: That sounds good. Is there anything else I should know?\n",
            "Doctor: Plate removal will be discussed during your follow-up visits, but it's important to keep attending those appointments. In some cases, patients might experience sensations like clicking with wrist motion or difficulty extending their thumb. If that happens, we'll need to address it.\n",

            "Doctor: We continued to monitor your condition, and your scalp hair was completely lost within a week. After further investigation, we've determined that you have thallium poisoning. This was confirmed by the elevated levels of thallium ion in your urine, which was 4677.0μg/l, and in your blood, which was 312.1μg/l. The normal range for urine is 5μg/l, and for blood, it's 0μg/l.\n",

            "Patient: Yes, that's what I've been told.\n",
            "Doctor: Your mean blood pressure is 110/60 mmHg, and you've been treated with an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) for IgAN with persistent proteinuria. Your urinary protein excretion levels have been about 0.5 g/day after the initiation of ARB. Two years later, you underwent a tonsillectomy for persistent proteinuria. Is that all correct?\n",

            "Doctor: In 2012, you were diagnosed with diabetes mellitus based on your fasting plasma glucose levels and haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels during regular visits. You were started on a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor and Pioglitazone. However, one year later, you discontinued both the regular visits to our hospital and your medication. What was the reason for that?\n",
            "Patient: I wasn't feeling well, and I thought I could manage it on my own.\n",
            "Doctor: I see. Seven days prior to your admission at our hospital, you visited a clinic for fatigue. Your random blood glucose level was 375 mg/dL, and based on this result and persistent proteinuria, you were referred to our hospital. How are you feeling now?\n",

The initial pressure was 5 mmHg by fluid-coupled measurements and 11.5 cm of H2O by fluid column method. We removed a total of 10 cc of clear CSF. The final pressure was 2 mmHg by fluid-coupled measurements and 3.5 cm of H2O by fluid column method. After the puncture, did you experience any changes in your headache?\n",

            "Doctor: I'm sorry to hear that. It seems your headache was persistent for 4 days and didn't improve with steroids, caffeine infusion, or hydrocodone-acetaminophen treatment. We conducted a magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium enhancement to further assess your condition. The results showed cerebellar tonsils descending through the foramen magnum, slit ventricles, and enhancement of the dura. \n",
            "Patient: Oh, that sounds serious.\n",
            "Doctor: It's a significant finding, but we proceeded with an epidural injection of whole blood to address your symptoms. How did you feel after the procedure?\n",
            "Patient: I felt much better! The headaches completely went away, and I'd rate them as 0 out of 10 now.\n",

            "Patient: It's about 3 cm from the thoracic midline on the right side, and I feel some intercostal irradiation too.\n",
            "Doctor: Thank you for that information. Based on the radiographs we took, we didn't find any osteolysis or deformity. However, the MRI showed a T2 hypersignal and a T1 hyposignal at the medial side of your right T1 vertebra, along with inflammation of the right T1 root. The radioisotope bone scanning also revealed lateral hyperfixation on the right side of your T1 vertebra.\n",
            "Patient: Oh, I see. What does that mean?\n",
            "Doctor: The CT scan showed an osteolytic lesion surrounded by sclerotic bone at the medial wall of your right T1 pedicle. The lesion is close to the dura mater and T1 spinal nerve, which is causing the inflammation and pain you're experiencing. The aspect of the lesion is compatible with a condition called osteoid osteoma.\n",
            "Patient: What can be done about it?\n",
            "Doctor: Our team recommends a surgical resection using a posterior approach with 3D imaging guidance. Because the lesion is so close to the dura mater, we cannot perform radiofrequency ablation, which would require thermal ablation. The surgery should be safe and complete, with no risk of recurrence. We'll also make sure to preserve the vertebral stability without needing screw fixation.\n",
            "Patient: What should I expect during the surgery?\n",
            "Doctor: You'll be in a prone position under general anesthesia. We'll use a new all-in-one imaging device called Surgivisio® to control the vertebral level in two-dimensional (2D) mode. This machine is a 2D/3D C-arm designed to be combined with surgical navigation. We'll perform a mini-open posterior approach at the C7-T2 levels.\n",

            "Patient: Yeah, that's right. I was then treated with something else, I think it was ipilimumab and nivolumab.\n",
            "Doctor: Yes, you were treated with four cycles of ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4, 3 mg/kg) and nivolumab (anti-PD-1, 1 mg/kg) every 3 weeks × 4. You experienced a partial response per immune-related response criteria, which lasted 30 weeks before your disease progressed again.\n",
            "Patient: I remember that. But those medications were given to me again, right?\n",
            "Doctor: Correct. Ipilimumab and nivolumab were administered again, but they resulted in PD at 14 weeks. After that, we decided to try a different approach.\n",

Your lungs were clear to auscultation, and there was no evidence of infection or blood loss. We started you on anticoagulation for pulmonary embolism. Do you remember if you had a CT chest done?\n",
            "Patient: No, they didn't do a CT chest initially because my creatinine was elevated at 1.6.\n",
            "Doctor: Right, so instead they did a ventilation/perfusion scan, or V/Q scan, which showed intermediate probability for pulmonary thromboembolism. We decided to continue your anticoagulation. However, you still had persistent tachycardia, and blood tests showed hypocalcemia at 6.8-7.9 mg/dL and hypokalemia at 3.2-3.4 mEQ/L, but your thyroid function was normal.\n",

As a result, we put you on metoprolol 50 mg twice daily and continued intravenous hydration with electrolyte supplementation. We eventually did a CT chest which confirmed the presence of old embolism and showed a 1.1 cm nodule in your left upper lobe.\n",

The upper enteroscopy showed an ulcer 150 cm distal to the Treitz ligament, measuring 3.0 x 2.0 cm. The ulcer had a white coating and peripheral mucosal hyperemia, occupying 2/3 of the lumen, making it difficult for the endoscope to pass through. We took four biopsies from the ulcer, and 20 cm proximal from the ulcer, we found many scattered irregular ulcers, from which we took two biopsies.\n",

            "Doctor: On the axial T2-weighted image and postgadolinium T1-weighted image with fat saturation, we did not find any mass in the right tonsil. The left tonsil showed mucosal crypts with linear enhancement, but on the right side, the crypts were partly obliterated by a large mass and did not display enhancement.\n",

            "Doctor: The surgery was successful. The histological examination of the specimen revealed diffuse sheets of monomorphous plasmacytoid cells with abundant eosinophilic finely granular cytoplasm and eccentric nuclei. We also observed occasional binucleated and pleomorphic cells with giant nuclei and prominent nucleoli, as well as mitotic figures.\n",
            "Patient: What does that mean?\n",
            "Doctor: These findings indicate that there is no amyloid deposition. Immunohistochemically, the plasma cells were diffusely immunoreactive for λ light chain and IgG. This means that the cells are producing a specific type of antibody, but it's not a sign of malignancy.\n",

            "Patient: What happened after the surgery?\n",
            "Doctor: On postoperative day 3, your liver function tests were still abnormal, and we found bloody fluids in the drain. An abdominal CT showed a characteristic hook-pattern on the anterior proximal celiac axis from compression of the MAL, which had not been detected in the preoperative CT. Ischemic changes in the remnant pancreas, hepatic lateral segment, and gastrojejunostomy site were also observed.\n",
            "Patient: Oh no, what does that mean?\n",
            "Doctor: Although all celiac branches were visible, there were almost no pulsations in those branches. We first tried interventional radiology, but the procedure failed due to tight compression against the outside of the celiac axis.\n",
            "Patient: So, what was the next step?\n",
            "Doctor: You underwent an urgent re-laparotomy to address the issue. I'll be monitoring your progress closely and provide further instructions based on your recovery.\n",

            "Patient: Sure, go ahead.\n",
            "Doctor: *Examines the patient* I can feel a circumscribed mass measuring approximately 6 cms in diameter in the infraumbilical region to the left of the midline. The mobility of the swelling seems to be restricted when you contract your muscles, which may suggest infiltration of the underlying musculoaponeurotic structures.\n",
            "Patient: What does that mean, exactly?\n",
            "Doctor: It means the mass may be affecting the muscles and tissues beneath the skin. We will need to conduct some laboratory investigations and a CT scan to get a clearer picture. \n",
            "Patient: Okay, let's do it.\n",
            "*After the tests*\n",
            "Doctor: The laboratory results are within normal limits, and the CT scan revealed a contrast-enhancing lesion in the subcutaneous tissues, infiltrating the underlying musculoaponeurotic structures. This is highly suggestive of an abdominal wall endometrioma.\n",
            "Patient: So, what's the next step for me?\n",
            "Doctor: The best course of action would be surgical resection. We would remove the endometrioma along with a portion of the underlying aponeurosis and rectus abdominis muscle.\n",
            "Patient: And after that?\n",
            "Doctor: We will place a polypropylene mesh over the defect created by the resection and fix it to the anterior rectus sheath with nonabsorbable sutures. This will help to reinforce the area and promote healing.\n",
            "Patient: What can I expect after the surgery?\n",
            "Doctor: The postoperative course should be uneventful. We will perform a histopathological evaluation of the resected specimen to ensure clear resection margins. Following the procedure, there should be no seroma at the operative site, and you should experience complete relief of symptoms.\n",

            "[15-20 minutes later]\n",
            "Doctor: I'm afraid we've encountered a serious issue. After receiving the chlorpromazine, you went into cardiac arrest. We initiated advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) interventions immediately. Your initial rhythm was ventricular fibrillation, requiring four defibrillations at 200 joules each. We also observed Torsades de pointes and administered 2 grams of intravenous magnesium.\n",

An arterial blood gas test showed metabolic acidosis with a pH of 7.22 (normal range is 7.38–7.42), a lactate level of 14 mmol/L (normal range is 0.60–2.40), and an ionized calcium level of 1.12 mmol/L (normal range is 1.10–1.33).

            "Doctor: Okay. We also conducted a positron emission tomography scan, which revealed hypermetabolic lesions in your anterior tongue and lymph nodes, suggesting malignancy. The assessment was a likely T3/4N2cM0 tongue squamous cell carcinoma. We performed a panendoscopy with biopsies and a physical examination under anesthesia for surgical planning. However, the biopsy results again did not show carcinoma but rather granulomatous inflammation without organisms present.\n",
            "Patient: So, what's the next step?\n",
            "Doctor: A multidisciplinary tumor board recommended a rheumatologic workup and an excisional lymph node biopsy. The lymph node biopsy results demonstrated noncaseating granulomatous inflammation with no malignancy, while laboratory results showed markedly elevated angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) levels. These findings suggested an atypical case of sarcoidosis, so we referred you for a pulmonary consultation.\n",

            "Doctor: Yes, your laboratory evaluation demonstrated T pallidum immunoglobulin G antibodies present with a reflex RPR titer of 1:512. We then analyzed the lymph node biopsy sample with immunohistochemistry (IHC), which revealed spirochetes. You were diagnosed with tertiary syphilis and started on doxycycline 100 mg twice daily for 30 days due to a severe penicillin allergy.\n",

            "Patient: Hmm, what does that mean?\n",
            "Doctor: It means that the tumor cells were positive for cytokeratin 20 (CK20) and had scattered positivity for caudal type homeobox 2 (CDX2).

            "Doctor: Your white blood cell count was 13.2 × 103/ml, erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 122 mm/hour, which is significantly higher than the reference rate of <20 mm/hour. Your hemoglobin was 10.4 g/dl, serum creatinine was 1.48 mg/dl, which is above the reference range of 0.6–1.1 mg/dl, and your glomerular filtration rate was 57 ml/min/1.73 m2, which is lower than the reference rate of >90 ml/min. The urinalysis showed proteinuria and hematuria with few red blood cell casts.\n",

Immunofluorescence indicated weak deposition of IgM, fibrinogen, and C1q in mesangio-capillary regions. An electron micrograph showed diffuse endothelial swelling with obliteration of capillary lumina. The pathology was diagnosed as renal-limited TMA. Other causes of nephrotic syndrome, such as focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, membranous nephropathy, and membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, were ruled out.\n",
            "Patient: So, was it the ramucirumab that caused all this?\n",

We will lateralize the rectus muscle and insert a Covidien Balloon Dissector preperitoneally from the umbilical incision of the skin to the symphysis pubis. The balloon will be insufflated to open the extraperitoneal area.

Additionally, your intra- and extra-hepatic bile ducts are obviously dilated, and your pancreatic duct is slightly dilated as well. The non-contrast CT scan showed calcification within the mass, and the contrast CT showed that the enhancement of the tumor is similar to the surrounding normal pancreatic parenchyma. Here's a figure for you to see (Fig.).\n",

The biopsy was negative for malignancy, but the PET showed abnormal hypermetabolic activity within a retrosternal nodule, intense activity in a mixed focus in the manubrium, and several hypermetabolic nodes within the mediastinum. It also showed an abnormal hypermetabolic focus in the cecum, which was suspicious for a colon primary. Is that correct?\n",

            "Doctor: At your presentation, the transthoracic echocardiography showed degenerative bicuspid aortic valve with fusion of the right and left coronary cusps. The appearance of the valve is consistent with severe aortic stenosis, which was confirmed by hemodynamic Doppler assessment. It revealed a peak gradient of 65 mm Hg, an aortic valve area of 0.9 cm2 derived from the continuity equation, and a dimensionless velocity index of 0.24. Your left ventricular function is normal with an ejection fraction of 59% by Simpson's method.\n",

Your white blood count and C-reactive protein (CRP) increased slightly to 9900 /mm3 and 4.64 mg/dl, respectively. Additionally, your albumin level decreased to 2.5 g/dl and your creatine level increased slightly to 1.14 mg/dl, with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 41.7 ml/min.

            "Doctor: In August 2016, you were readmitted to the hospital due to recurrent right arm weakness and slurred speech. The MRI showed multiple cerebral infarctions in both cerebral hemispheres and the cerebellum. At this point, Trousseau's syndrome was suspected. Do you remember that?\n",
            "Patient: Yes, I do.\n",
            "Doctor: So, your apixaban was stopped and you were given an intravenous drip of heparin instead. Echocardiography revealed mild mitral regurgitation with vegetation on the mitral valve. Although your lab results showed no evidence of infection, you were given ceftriaxone and gentamicin as a precaution against infective endocarditis. You were then referred to our hospital for surgery. \n",

So, cardiac surgery was performed on day 5 after your referral. \n",
            "Patient: Okay, and what happened during the surgery?\n",
            "Doctor: During the surgery, extracorporeal circulation was instituted employing aortic and bicaval cannulation. After aortic cross-clamping, the mitral valve was exposed via a left atriotomy. Both mitral leaflets had vegetation on the surface, and a major vegetation 15 mm in width was evident on the anterior leaflet. These were resected in their entirety and replaced with a 25-mm Epic bioprosthesis.\n",

Based on the physical examination and the tests we ran, it appears that you have a growth plate fracture in your right distal radius, specifically a Salter–Harris type II fracture. You were initially treated with cast immobilization and closed reduction, which allowed the fracture to heal. However, the wrist pain and deformity you're experiencing now are due to a condition called partial physeal arrest.\n",
            "Patient: Oh, I see. What does that mean?\n",
            "Doctor: Partial physeal arrest occurs when the growth plate in your wrist is damaged, causing it to stop growing properly. In your case, radiographs showed a shortening deformity of the distal radius and an abnormal radial inclination of the articular surface. A CT scan was also performed to evaluate the deformity and for preoperative simulation with a low-radiation setting.\n",

            "Patient: Well, I had an MRI which showed an infiltrative lesion with poorly defined contours in my left temporal lobe. It also showed an increase in the left temporal gyrus cortex.\n",
            "Doctor: Hmm, it seems like the lesion compromised a large part of your temporal lobe and extended to the temporal isthmus, the posterior aspect of the insula, and was deep in the trigeminal effigy of the left lateral ventricle. There was also diffuse erasure of the regional cortical sulci and the Sylvian fissure, with slight compression over the atrium of the left lateral ventricle. Did you have a biopsy done to confirm the diagnosis?\n",
            "Patient: Yes, I had a stereotactic biopsy in April 2014, and it indicated oligodendroglioma grade II.\n",

            "Patient: I received TMZ with cycles every 23 days from September 2014 to July 2015. But in 2016, there was tumor growth, so I had an MRI in February.\n",
            "Doctor: What did the MRI show about the evolution of the tumor?\n",
            "Patient: The MRI showed an increase in the dimensions of the remaining lesion, especially in the temporal isthmus, which had a similar expansive effect on the adjacent encephalic structures.\n",
            "Doctor: I understand. And what was the next step in your treatment?\n",
            "Patient: I underwent a partial surgical resection followed by chemoradiation and lasting 6 cycles of PCV associated with CBD. The CBD dosage ranged from 100 to 200 mg/day.\n",
            "Doctor: How was your overall health and well-being during the chemoradiation?\n",

            "Patient: Sure, doc. I was diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma of the maxillary gingiva in May 2005. I had to undergo a bunch of surgeries like extended left maxillectomy, anterior and middle cranial base resection, left ophthalmectomy, and flap reconstruction using the rectus abdominis muscle.\n",
            "Doctor: I see. During your physical examination, I noticed a recessed deformation on the left side of your face due to the left ophthalmectomy. The function of your left levator palpebrae muscle has been eliminated to a slight elevation using the frontal muscle. There's also a metal plate anchored to the inferior wall of your orbit. How have you been managing with these changes?\n",
            "Patient: It's been tough, but I'm getting used to it.\n",
            "Doctor: I also observed that during the mesh titanium plate reconstruction, your left ethmoid bone, inferior nasal turbinate, maxilla, alisphenoid, medial and lateral pterygoid muscle were excised. Intraorally, your left maxilla has been excised from the midline and the rectus abdominis muscle flap was sutured directly to your soft palate. The peripheral mucous membrane around your left upper lip is scarred, without the oral vestibule. Have you experienced any discomfort or difficulty with this?\n",
            "Patient: Yes, sometimes it's uncomfortable and the flap margin has moved along with the surrounding soft tissue.\n",
            "Doctor: I see that the 70 × 50 mm flap is sagging from its weight and is in contact with your mandibular molars, which reduces the volume of your oral cavity unless you wear dentures. Your maxilla has been removed from the midline to the maxillary tuberosity, while your mandible has been removed from the anterior border of the ramus to the coronoid process. Has this caused any issues with your dentures?\n",

            "Doctor: It means that the tumor is a specific type, and it's not as aggressive as some other types. We also performed complementary immunophenotypic characterization, which suggested a MB with SHH activation and TP53 wild-type. The nuclear INI-1 staining was preserved, and P53 immunostaining showed nuclear positivity only in a small proportion of the tumor cells.\n",

            "Doctor: I understand. The MRI of your back and leg were negative, except for inflammation noted in the ligaments around your right knee. We also performed an EEG because of the frequent seizure-like activity, but it was negative, so the diagnosis is pseudoseizures. We've tried treating your pain with several drugs, including Toradol, Motrin, Tylenol, Oxycontin, and even IV morphine. Have these medications provided any relief?\n",

Videos taken of you show severe pain and seizure activity. After 3 months of these unrelenting symptoms, you've come to my office. We've obtained informed consent to try ozone therapy using direct intravenous gas (DIV). We'll start with five treatments per week, for 26 weeks, totaling 120 treatments.

            "Patient: Oh, that's good news!\n",
            "Doctor: Yes, it is. However, you had a nondisplaced Salter-Harris type II fracture of the distal left femur due to a fall, which required surgical fixation. You were discharged home on the day of the operation. How did that go?\n",
            "Patient: The surgery went well, and I was able to go home the same day.\n",
            "Doctor: Unfortunately, you presented to the emergency department two days after your operation with a seizure, tachycardia, tachypnea, and fever up to 38.6 degrees Celsius. You experienced progressive acute hypoxic respiratory failure, which required mechanical ventilation. Do you remember that?\n",
            "Patient: Yes, I was really scared when that happened.\n",
            "Doctor: Shortly after intubation, you developed pulmonary hemorrhage and anemia. We treated this with fresh frozen plasma, ventilator adjustments, and blood transfusion. A fast spin MRI of your head came back negative. \n",
            "Patient: Oh, that's a relief.\n",
            "Doctor: We also performed a CT scan of your chest, which demonstrated bilateral patchy infiltrates. Thankfully, no pulmonary embolism was identified. Your ECHO revealed mildly elevated tricuspid regurgitation velocities, representing increased right ventricular and pulmonary artery pressures. \n",
            "Patient: What does that mean, doc?\n",
            "Doctor: It means that there was some increased pressure in your heart and lungs, which could have contributed to your symptoms. We placed you on broad-spectrum antibiotics for 72 hours, but your blood, urine, and mini BAL tests remained negative.\n",
            "Patient: So, what happened next?\n",
            "Doctor: Mechanical ventilation was able to be weaned, and you were extubated on day five of your admission. You were then transferred to the pediatric floor and later discharged home without any residual effects from the entire event.\n",

            "Patient: No, I haven't had any of those issues.\n",
            "Doctor: That's good to know. To further investigate your seizures, we've done a seizure workup which included a video EEG. It confirmed that your paresthesias and phantosmia are caused by right temporal lobe epilepsy. We also performed computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, which demonstrated a right temporal lobe encephalocele.\n",
            "Patient: Oh, I see.\n",
            "Doctor: In addition to the TLE, the MRI showed increased edema and flair signal within your right mesial temporal lobe. We discussed your case at a multidisciplinary skull base conference, and the decision was made to proceed with a combined mastoid-middle cranial fossa encephalocele repair surgery. Informed consent was obtained from you prior to the surgery.\n",
            "Patient: Yes, I remember.\n",
            "Doctor: During the surgery, we repaired a 1 x 1 cm tegmen defect with the herniation of glial tissue into the mastoid. We performed a partial resection and used an Onlay dural substitute to fix the defect. Your postoperative course went smoothly.\n",
            "Patient: That's good to hear. I did notice an improvement in my seizure frequency and duration after the surgery, but they haven't fully resolved.\n",
            "Doctor: Yes, we've noticed that as well. A repeat 3T epilepsy protocol MRI showed further hippocampal atrophy, increased flair within the right hippocampus, and the loss of gray-white differentiation in the anterior temporal lobe. This has led us to diagnose you with mesial temporal lobe sclerosis.\n",
            "Patient: Oh, okay.\n",
            "Doctor: On a retrospective neuroradiology review, we observed the progression of decreased hippocampal volume in your MRIs leading up to the surgery. Currently, we are working on a plan for the resection of the temporal epileptically focal lesion to better manage your condition.\n",

            "Doctor: I see. Based on your condition, you might need a nephro-ureterostomy stent placement. This procedure will help alleviate your symptoms. We'll use fluoroscopic guidance to accurately place the stent.\n",
            "Patient: Hmm, how does that work?\n",
            "Doctor: First, we'll introduce a 21-gauge needle through your skin into an inferior renal calyx. Then, we'll perform an antegrade pyelogram to visualize the opacification of your collecting system.\n",
            "Patient: Okay, and what happens after that?\n",
            "Doctor: After demonstrating the return of urine, we'll pass a wire through the needle and introduce a dilator over the wire. We may use multiple catheters and wires to attempt to gain access to the collecting system.\n",
            "Patient: Alright, and how long does the procedure usually take?\n",
            "Doctor: It varies for each patient but could take around two hours. In some cases, we might have to abandon the procedure if we can't access the central renal pelvis due to the obstructive staghorn calculus. However, we'll do our best to ensure the procedure is successful.\n",
            "Patient: I see. What other options do you have if the initial attempts don't work?\n",
            "Doctor: We could use a SwiftNINJA® SMC catheter from Merit Medical Systems. It's designed to easily navigate around the staghorn calculus and eventually reach the proximal ureter.\n",
            "Patient: That sounds like a good option.\n",
            "Doctor: Yes, once we reach the ureter, we'll use a Platinum Plus™ guidewire from Boston Scientific to guide the SMC into the bladder. Then, we'll exchange the SMC for a 4-French Berenstein catheter and place an 8.5-French nephro-ureterostomy stent from Cook Medical.\n",
            "Patient: And where will the stent be placed?\n",
            "Doctor: The distal loop of the stent will be formed in your urinary bladder. However, due to the space-occupying staghorn calculus, we might be unable to form the proximal loop in the renal pelvis. But don't worry, we'll inject contrast through the stent to ensure proper flow.\n",
            "Patient: Okay, thank you for explaining the procedure to me. I'm ready to move forward with the stent placement.\n",

During your physical exam here, we noticed disorganized high amplitude conjugate horizontal eye movements that persisted even with eye closure, severe truncal ataxia that prevented you from sitting up without support, and distinct abdominal myoclonus. However, your other neurological exam results, including your mental status, were unremarkable. We started you on symptomatic and empiric therapy with lorazepam, levetiracetam, and a 5-day course of high-dose IV methylprednisolone. How are you feeling now?\n",
            "Patient: Hmm, I do feel a bit better, but I'm still struggling with some of my symptoms.\n",
            "Doctor: I understand. We did some additional tests on your cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). It showed a lymphocytic pleocytosis with 25 WBCs, but an otherwise unremarkable profile. Cytology was negative for malignancy, and flow cytometry demonstrated a T cell dominant inflammatory process, believed to be reactive. Your paraneoplastic panel in the CSF was negative; however, we detected voltage-gated potassium channel antibodies (VGKC) in your serum at 0.05 nmol/L, which is above the normal range of <0.02 nmol/L.\n",

            "Doctor: We placed a nasogastric tube and instituted therapeutic strategies to improve abdominal-wall compliance, such as changes in ventilation parameters, nasogastric suction, changing your position to supine, and removal of any strap over the abdomen. A plain abdominal radiography in the operating room showed a massive pneumoperitoneum.\n",
            "Patient: What did you decide to do after that?\n",

            "Doctor: It appears that at that juncture, an examination identified a large knee effusion, erythema, and minimal tolerance for knee range-of-motion. They also inspected the fracture site and found mild erythema with serosanguinous drainage. They aspirated the knee and found cloudy yellow fluid. The analysis showed a white cell count of over 100,000 with 96% neutrophils, and the cultures grew gram-negative rods. Your care was then transferred to me. \n",

            "Patient: That must be why my knee was so infected.\n",
            "Doctor: Yes, the grass likely contributed to the infection. We performed a synovectomy to remove the loculated tissue in the knee, and we extended the surgical footprint at the fracture site to allow for debridement of the bone and soft tissue. We removed nonviable skin, which resulted in a 1x3 cm soft-tissue defect directly over the anteromedial tibial fracture site. \n",

There's no apparent erythema or other signs of infection in the cutaneous region overlying the mass. Your CRP and WBC are normal, at 1.8 mg/L and 4.4 × 109/L, respectively. We performed a CT scan and it revealed a suspected femoral hernia with adjacent inflammation and a tubular structure, presumed to be the vermiform appendix, in the hernia-sack. There were no radiological signs of small bowel obstruction.\n",

An echocardiography was also performed, revealing a peri-membranous VSD with a diameter of 12 mm, left to right shunting, and a pressure gradient of 20 mmHg. Additionally, we found a PDA with a diameter of 4 mm. \n",
            "Patient: Oh, that sounds serious. What did you do to treat it?\n",
            "Doctor: First, we performed a trans-catheter PDA closure. Then, 3 weeks later, we did a TES for VSD repair without robotic assistance. During the procedure, you were placed in a supine position with your arms along your body, under general anesthesia with a single-lumen endotracheal tube.\n",
            "Patient: What else did you do during the surgery?\n",
            "Doctor: We used a no.6 Knitted Dacron graft to connect your right common FA with an end-to-side anastomosis. The other side of the graft was connected to the arterial line of the cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) machine. We also inserted SVC and IVC cannulae via your internal jugular vein (IJV) and femoral vein, respectively, using the Seldinger technique.\n",
            "Patient: And then what happened?\n",
            "Doctor: When we started the CPB, your arterial pressure gradually increased to 260 mmHg. So, we switched to bilateral FA cannulation by inserting an additional 10Fr FA cannula directly into your left common FA. After that, your arterial pressure declined and stabilized at 180-200 mmHg.\n",

Painful crepitation and moderate tenderness are present during knee motion. There's also a large, non-tender cystic mass in the posterior aspect of the right knee joint. I noticed crepitation in your left knee too, but you mentioned no discomfort on the left side, correct?\n",

            "Doctor: The CT scan revealed a retroperitoneal hematoma in your pancreatic head, aneurysm formation in the PDA, and extraluminal compression to the celiac trunk. Extravasation was also detected around the aneurysm in the PDA, but no liquid was retained in your peritoneal cavity.\n",

            "(After the procedure)\n",
            "Doctor: The imaging of the SMA revealed the development of several collaterals in your pancreatic head, and the common and proper hepatic arteries were imaged via these collaterals. The aneurysm in your PDA had leakage of the contrast-enhanced agent with a diameter of 9.3 mm. We have completed the IVR hemostasis by performing PDA coil embolization.\n",
            "Patient: So, what's next?\n",
            "Doctor: We will conduct SMA arteriography to see the other collaterals perfusing your proper hepatic artery. After the IVR therapy, we will monitor your blood chemical analysis for several weeks to ensure that your transaminase level is not elevated and hepatic infarction is negative.\n",

            "Patient: That's a relief. What could have caused all this?\n",
            "Doctor: In your case, collateral perfusion pathways from the SMA developed to compensate for the reduced CA blood flow due to MAL compression, and the aneurysm might have been generated in the PDA due to the abnormal changes in hemodynamic flow. Preservative treatment did not appear to relieve the CA compression. Additionally, we considered that new aneurysms may form following new collateral circulation after IVR hemostasis.\n",

            "Doctor: Although the body of your appendix looked intact, as well as your ileum and cecum, the histopathological examination revealed PAA in the tip of the resected appendix. Because of this, we have planned a radical operation for the residual tumor of PAA in your pelvic cavity.\n",
            "Patient: What does that operation involve?\n",
            "Doctor: It involves a whole mass resection and ileocecal resection with lymph node dissection. In the first operation, we speculate that we removed the body of your appendix but left most of the mass and the tip of the appendix. So in the second operation, we will remove the mass that was derived from the tip of your appendix.\n",

            "Patient: Yeah, I've been having right eye periorbital swelling, redness, and my upper right lid is drooping. I've also been experiencing bilateral tearing.\n",
            "Doctor: I understand. When did these symptoms start?\n",
            "Patient: They began about 24 hours ago, right after I received my first zoledronic acid infusion for osteoporosis.\n",
            "Doctor: Thank you for that information. Based on your past medical history, I see that you have chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, Sjogren's syndrome, and systemic lupus erythematosus. You've been on cyclosporine 75 mg daily and monthly belimumab 120 mg/1.5 ml for your rheumatologic conditions for 3 years prior to this presentation, correct?\n",
            "Patient: Yes, that's correct.\n",
            "Doctor: Let's discuss your ophthalmic exam results. Your best-corrected visual acuity was 20/25–2 in the right eye and 20/25–3 in the left eye. Intraocular pressure was 14 mmHg in the right eye and 13 mmHg in the left eye. The external exam of your right eye showed mild upper lid edema, erythema, ptosis, and a -1 adduction defect. Do you know what a slit lamp examination is?\n",
            "Patient: I'm not sure, can you explain?\n",
            "Doctor: Sure, a slit lamp examination allows us to take a closer look at the structures of your eye. In your case, we found conjunctival chemosis, which is swelling of the eye's outer surface, but no issues with the anterior chamber or any flare. Additionally, the posterior segment exam showed that you have posterior vitreous detachment (PVD) in both eyes.\n",
            "Patient: Oh, I see.\n",
            "Doctor: We also attempted 24–2 visual field testing, but it wasn't reliable due to frequent fixation loss caused by your eye pain. Based on your symptoms and history, we ordered a contrast-enhanced MRI which showed ill-defined right orbital soft tissue thickening and enhancement in the retro-orbital intraconal space with extension along the retro-orbital scleral contour and surrounding the anterior optic nerve sheath.\n",
            "Patient: What does that mean?\n",
            "Doctor: Considering your rheumatologic history, we initially thought it could be orbital inflammation secondary to your lupus. However, based on the clinical presentation, MRI findings, and the timing of your symptoms in relation to your zoledronic acid infusion, we suspect that your orbital inflammation might be secondary to bisphosphonate therapy.\n",
            "Patient: Oh, okay. So, what do we do now?\n",
            "Doctor: We will start you on oral medications to manage the inflammation and monitor your symptoms closely. We will also keep in touch with your rheumatologist to ensure the best course of action for your treatment. If your symptoms worsen or do not improve, please return to the clinic immediately.\n",

            "Patient: Yes, that's correct.\n",
            "Doctor: On your examination, we found symmetrical lower limb motor weakness in an upper motor neuron pattern with Medical Research Council (MRC) muscle power 4/5 both proximally and distally. We also observed reduced sensations in your lower limbs symmetrically to fine touch, pinprick, temperature, and proprioception, which progressed to significant sensory loss over the next couple of weeks. Your sensory level is slightly below the umbilicus at T11. However, there was no spinal tenderness. Do you have any questions so far?\n",
            "Patient: No, I understand. Thank you for explaining.\n",
            "Doctor: Additionally, your deep tendon reflexes in lower limbs were exaggerated with extensor plantar responses. The rest of your general and systemic examination was unremarkable. We conducted blood tests, including full blood count, inflammatory markers, B12, folate, thyroid functions, calcium, liver function test, and myeloma screen, which all came back normal. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis on the second day after admission was also normal with normal protein, glucose, and cytology, etc. Have you had any concerns about these tests?\n",
            "Patient: No, I'm glad everything was normal.\n",
            "Doctor: Finally, we evaluated you with a non-contrast MRI spine, which showed focal myelopathic cord signal at the conus and at the level of T10 and T11 vertebrae. The radiological differential diagnosis on MRI includes B12 deficiency, inflammatory, or infection-related causes. We will continue to investigate and monitor your condition closely. It's important that you follow up with us as needed and adhere to any recommendations we provide. Do you have any questions or concerns?\n",

            "Patient: What does that mean?\n",
            "Doctor: Mildly elevated troponin levels could indicate some stress on your heart, but it's a good sign that they are decreasing. Your chest x-ray showed mild cardiomegaly and increased pulmonary vasculature. Additionally, your EKG revealed a new left bundle branch block (LBBB).\n",
            "Patient: And what about the echocardiogram?\n",
            "Doctor: During your initial BSE, your blood pressure was 252/163, with a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 170, and your peak longitudinal strain (PLS) was -3.5%. The ejection fraction (EF) was not calculated, but it was estimated to be mildly reduced. Six hours later, your blood pressure improved to 171/94 (MAP = 123), and we performed a repeat BSE with a recalculated PLS.\n",

            "Patient: Yes, I remember.\n",
            "Doctor: We also did an electrocardiogram-gated cardiac computed tomography (EG-CT) that revealed two sinus of Valsalva aneurysms (SVAs) in both the left and right coronary sinuses, with no obstruction to surrounding cardiac structures. The sizes of the SVAs were 27.2 mm and 33.1 mm for the left and right sides, respectively. Due to their relatively small size, we decided to observe them carefully for 5 years. \n",

The transthoracic echocardiography also showed moderate aortic regurgitation. The SVA in the left coronary sinus has grown between the pulmonary artery and the left atrium, bulging out on the anterior surface of the heart. The SVA in the right coronary sinus has also grown, pressing the right ventricular outflow tract.\n",
            "Patient: That doesn't sound good.\n",

            "Patient: Hi, doctor. Yes, I've had episodes of jaundice during each of my pregnancies. I'm fourth gravida, with one live issue after a fourth-degree consanguineous marriage. The jaundice usually starts in the late second trimester and subsides slowly over two to three months after delivery. Between pregnancies, I have minimal or no jaundice.\n",
            "Doctor: I see. And during these years, have you experienced any other symptoms, such as fever, pruritus, malaise, or abdominal pain?\n",
            "Patient: No, doctor. I've been mostly asymptomatic, except for the jaundice. I don't have a history of fever, pruritus, malaise, or abdominal pain. I'm also a non-alcoholic and a non-smoker.\n",

            "Patient: No, I don't have any history of those things.\n",
            "Doctor: Thank you for providing this information. Now, regarding your bilirubin levels, your pre-pregnancy levels were in the range of 3.0-4.0 mg/dL, which is higher than the normal value of 0.1-1.2 mg/dL. During the second trimester of each pregnancy, these levels would rise to about 11.0-12.0 mg/dL. Is that correct?\n",
            "Patient: Yes, that's correct.\n",
            "Doctor: It appears that you typically have isolated conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, with conjugated bilirubin levels rising to as high as 8.0 to 10.0 mg/dL, while unconjugated bilirubin remains in the range of 2.0-3.0 mg/dL. Your liver function test has always been normal, with serum transaminase levels less than 20 IU/L and serum bile acid levels and proteins within the normal range. Is that accurate?\n",
            "Patient: Yes, that's right.\n",
            "Doctor: Given the absence of pruritus and normal bile acid levels and serum transaminases, we can exclude the diagnosis of intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy. Additionally, there is no associated gestational hypertension or proteinuria. Your hemogram is unremarkable, and your peripheral smear has never shown any evidence of hemolysis. Therefore, thrombotic microangiopathies have also been ruled out. Have you ever had an ultrasound of your abdomen?\n",
            "Patient: Yes, I had an ultrasound, and it showed a normal liver span and echotexture.\n",
            "Doctor: That's good to hear. Lastly, have you been tested for viral markers related to hepatitis during your pregnancies?\n",
            "Patient: Yes, I have, and the tests have always come back negative.\n",
            "Doctor: Thank you for all this information. It seems that most common causes of jaundice during pregnancy have been ruled out. We will continue to monitor your bilirubin levels and liver function, and I will discuss your case with other specialists to determine the best course of action for your future pregnancies. Please make sure to schedule regular check-ups throughout your pregnancy and follow any further recommendations we may have.\n",

            "Doctor: Yes, your left eye appears normal, with a cup-to-disc ratio of less than 0.1, suggesting a \"disc-at-risk.\" Let's perform a Fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA) for your right eye. *After FFA* There is late optic-disc staining in your right eye. \n",
            "Patient: What about other tests?\n",
            "Doctor: We conducted cardiac and carotid Doppler ultrasound, autoimmune, and hypercoagulability tests. They were normal, except for slightly raised serum cholesterol levels. We also did a cranial computed tomography (CT) scan that revealed previously unknown white matter lesions. Based on these findings, you have been diagnosed with NA-AION associated with cerebral SVD.\n",

            "Patient: What's going on with my left eye now?\n",
            "Doctor: Upon examination, there is edematous and flame-shaped retinal hemorrhaging at the border of the left ONH, vascular tortuosity, fluorescein leakage during FFA, and severe widespread visual field loss with central-sparing. This suggests a NA-AION in your left eye as well.\n",

            "Patient: Oh no, that sounds serious. What does that mean?\n",

            "Patient: No, none of those things apply to me.\n",
            "Doctor: Alright, let's proceed with a physical examination. *After examination* You are afebrile and have normal vital signs. I did notice a palpable spleen but no other organomegaly. There was no tenderness, guarding, or rigidity. Your chest, cardiovascular, genital, neurologic, and extremities examinations were unremarkable.\n",
            "Patient: Okay, so what's next?\n",
            "Doctor: We'll need to conduct some laboratory studies. *After studies* Your leukocyte count is 15,000 × 109/L, and your eosinophil count is 800 cells × 109/L, which is higher than the normal level of less than 500 × 109/L. All other parameters of the complete blood count and differential markers of renal and hepatic function, including serum calcium, are within normal limits.\n",
            "Patient: What does that mean for me?\n",
            "Doctor: We also performed a chest radiograph, which showed no consolidation, effusion, or cardiomegaly. An abdominal ultrasound was done, but it was nondiagnostic. However, abdominal computed tomography (CT) imaging revealed the presence of an enlarged spleen measuring 16 × 7 × 6 cm with multiple hypodense lesions. The liver was reported to be normal without any evidence of hepatomegaly. No lymphadenopathy was seen on the imaging studies.\n",
            "Patient: That doesn't sound good. What could be causing all of this?\n",
            "Doctor: Your systemic symptoms along with the splenomegaly and multiple hypodense splenic lesions raise high suspicion for a primary hematologic malignancy or a primary splenic tumor. We performed a normal peripheral blood smear and a normal bone marrow examination to investigate further.\n",
            "Patient: What do the results show?\n",
            "Doctor: We also conducted a full-body positron emission tomography (PET) scan. The PET scan showed multiple hypermetabolic splenic lesions with an SUV of 13.0 and no pathologic uptake in any other areas.\n",
            "Patient: So, what's the next step?\n",
            "Doctor: We will need to consult with a specialist to determine the best course of action for your treatment. They will be able to provide more information on your condition and the most appropriate options moving forward. We will keep you informed and involved throughout the process.\n",

            "Patient: Hi, I've been having abdominal pain for about 2 weeks now, and it's been getting worse. I also noticed some bleeding in my stool.\n",
            "Doctor: I see. Have you experienced any nausea, vomiting, fever, or weight loss recently?\n",
            "Patient: No, I haven't had any of those symptoms.\n",
            "Doctor: Do you have any personal history of medical or surgical diseases? And is there any history of malignant disease in your family?\n",
            "Patient: No, I don't have any history of medical or surgical diseases, and there's no history of malignant disease in my family either.\n",
            "Doctor: Okay, let's do an initial clinical observation. *After examining the patient* You appear to be haemodynamically stable. I can feel a painless mass in your periumbilical region, left hypochondrium, and left flank. There's also evidence of low gastrointestinal bleeding, or hematochezia. We'll need to get some tests done to find the cause.\n",
            "Patient: Alright, what tests do I need?\n",
            "Doctor: First, let's check your haemoglobin. *After checking* Your initial haemoglobin value at admission is 133 g/dl. We'll also perform an emergency non-total colonoscopy to look for any gastrointestinal lesions that could cause the bleeding.\n",
            "Patient: Okay, let me know what you find.\n",
            "Doctor: *After colonoscopy* We didn't find any lesions during the colonoscopy. We'll need to perform an Angio-CT to get more information. *After Angio-CT* The scan showed a large exophytic mass, approximately 20 x 14 x 13 cm, arising from the 4th duodenal segment and first jejunal segment. It has vascularization provided from branches of the upper mesenteric artery, with vascular dilatations inside the tumor and apparent intratumoral bleeding. However, there's no intraperitoneal bleeding.\n",
            "Patient: Oh, that doesn't sound good. What are my options?\n",
            "Doctor: Unfortunately, your condition has deteriorated, and you've become haemodynamically instable with a new episode of low gastrointestinal bleeding. Your haemoglobin value has dropped to 8.6 g/dl, so we'll need to provide fluid resuscitation and blood transfusion.\n",
            "Patient: I understand. What's the next step?\n",
            "Doctor: Due to your haemodynamic instability, we'll need to perform an emergency laparotomy. *After surgery* We found a large tumor arising from the first jejunal segment, 2 cm after the duodenal-jejunal flexure. We performed a segmental enterectomy, resecting the mass and adjacent jejunum and the 4th duodenal segment. A side-to-side manual anastomosis was performed between the 3rd duodenal segment and the jejunum.\n",
            "Patient: How did the surgery go?\n",
            "Doctor: The surgery went well, and you're now in the post-operative period. There were no complications, and we'll be monitoring your recovery.\n",
            "Patient: When can I start eating again?\n",
            "Doctor: You can start oral feeding on the 7th post-operative day. We'll perform a gastrointestinal oral contrast study to confirm the integrity of the anastomosis before allowing you to eat.\n",
            "Patient: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate your help and guidance during this difficult time.\n",
            "Doctor: You're welcome. We'll be here to support you throughout your recovery. If you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to reach out.\n",

            "Patient: Yes, it's been really difficult to deal with.\n",
            "Doctor: I understand you were diagnosed with right-sided, multicentric, infiltrating lobular carcinoma of the breast 10 years ago. You were Stage 1A, estrogen receptor positive (ER+), progesterone receptor positive (PR+), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative (HER2-). Is that correct?\n",
            "Patient: Hmm, yes, that's right.\n",
            "Doctor: And you had a right mastectomy, with sentinel lymph nodes sampled during surgery, which were negative for metastases. You were also treated with adjuvant anastrozole for five years, and yearly mammograms have been negative for recurrence. Is that accurate?\n",
            "Patient: Yes, that's correct.\n",
            "Doctor: I see that one year prior to this presentation, you were evaluated at our hospital for similar complaints of nausea and vomiting. A computed tomography (CT) scan of your abdomen and pelvis on admission revealed a mass-like thickening of the gastric antrum and distension of the proximal stomach. Do you remember that?\n",
            "Patient: Yes, I do.\n",
            "Doctor: An upper endoscopy (EGD) was performed, which revealed esophagitis and gastric stenosis. This was dilated using a through-the-scope controlled radial expansion (CRE) balloon, without fluoroscopic guidance. Biopsy of the gastric stenosis revealed gastric mucosa of antral type with minimal chronic inactive gastritis. No morphologic evidence of a Helicobacter pylori infection was detected. Did your symptoms of nausea and vomiting improve following balloon dilation?\n",
            "Patient: Yes, they did improve after that.\n",
            "Doctor: Good to hear. You were discharged on a daily proton pump inhibitor. Now, you underwent an endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) 12 weeks later. Gastric stenosis was found at the pylorus and duodenal bulb, which was dilated again with a CRE balloon to a maximum dilation of 13.5 mm. Do you recall this?\n",
            "Patient: Yes, I remember that.\n",
            "Doctor: The EUS also showed diffuse wall thickening of the antrum of the stomach, with the gastric wall measuring up to 11 mm in thickness. Thickening within the deep mucosa, submucosa, and muscularis propria was noted. EUS-guided biopsies were taken. Unfortunately, the biopsies revealed invasive poorly differentiated metastatic breast adenocarcinoma.\n",
            "Patient: Oh no, that's terrible news.\n",
            "Doctor: I understand this is difficult to hear. Our team will work closely with you to determine the best course of treatment and provide support throughout the process. We'll do everything we can to help you.\n",

            "Patient: Initially, my neck pain improved, but over the last nine months, my swallowing function has gradually worsened.\n",
            "Doctor: I see. You also experienced loss of reduction and progressive dysphagia, along with severe weight loss, right?\n",
            "Patient: Yes, exactly. I was referred to your hospital because of these issues.\n",
            "Doctor: Thank you for providing that information. I also see in your medical history that you have hypertension and mild diabetes mellitus, with an HbA1c of 6.2% NGSP. Have you been receiving antitubercular treatment since your diagnosis?\n",
            "Patient: Yes, I've been taking the prescribed medications from my local hospital.\n",
            "Doctor: Good to know. Now, let's discuss your current condition. Your height is 165 cm, and your weight is 52 kg, which gives you a BMI of 19. You've lost 25 kg over the past 7 months due to difficulty in swallowing. Are you currently using a nasogastric (NG) tube for feeding?\n",
            "Patient: Yes, I am. It's been helping me get the nutrition I need.\n",
            "Doctor: That's important for your recovery. During your neurological examination, we found left dominant proximal arm muscle weakness with atrophy, dysesthesia in distal fingers, and hyperreflexia throughout with bilateral extensor plantar reflex. In your oral examination, we noticed left tongue atrophy and left tongue deviation, consistent with unilateral HNP. Your routine blood work showed a slightly elevated level of C reactive protein (CRP), but the other findings were normal. Does this sound accurate to you?\n",
            "Patient: Yes, that's what I've been told.\n",
            "Doctor: We also performed a chest X-ray, which showed no specific abnormality. However, the lateral cervical X-ray showed an O-C2 angle of 17-degree kyphosis. Computed tomography (CT) revealed an erosive lesion at the dens and anterior arch of the atlas. Have you experienced any pain or discomfort in that area?\n",
            "Patient: Yes, I have. It's been quite bothersome.\n",
            "Doctor: I can imagine. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a space-occupying lesion in the retropharyngeal space, which presented with heterogeneous signals on both T1- and T2-weighted images. Interestingly, a review of your previous imaging studies showed that the lesion has been gradually decreasing in size, despite the progression of O-C kyphosis. \n",
            "Patient: Oh, that's good to hear.\n",
            "Doctor: So, your main problems right now are severe dysphagia and subsequent malnutrition, as well as neck pain. We will continue to monitor your condition and adjust your treatment plan as needed. In the meantime, it's important to continue using the NG tube for feeding and taking your antitubercular medications.\n",
            "Patient: Alright, thank you for explaining everything to me.\n",

            "Doctor: I see. Do you have any other medical history we should be aware of?\n",
            "Patient: No, the rest of my medical history is free.\n",
            "Doctor: Alright, let's start with a clinical examination. *Examines patient* I notice a polypoid lesion protruding from your right nostril, asymmetry of your face, and projection of the ipsilateral canine fossa.\n",
            "Patient: What does that mean?\n",
            "Doctor: We'll need to perform a computed tomography of your paranasal sinuses to get a clearer picture of what's going on. *Reviews CT results* The CT shows an inhomogeneous soft-tissue mass that completely occupies your right nasal cavity, maxillary sinus, and anterior and posterior ethmoidal cells. The lesion has caused extensive bone remodeling of your right maxillary sinus with complete absence of its anterior wall, erosion of the posterior wall, and entry of the lesion in the pterygopalatine fossa. There's also erosion of the ipsilateral lower and median orbital wall, and entry of the lesion in the orbital cavity. Despite its large size, the lesion seems to be well-defined without invasive characteristics.\n",
            "Patient: That sounds serious. What do the laboratory tests say?\n",
            "Doctor: Your routine laboratory tests are within the normal range. We also had a preoperative maxillofacial consultation, which excluded pathology of odontogenic origin.\n",
            "Patient: What's the next step, then?\n",
            "Doctor: We'll have you undergo a biopsy under local anesthesia. *Performs biopsy* The findings show nonspecific inflammation. We'll need to perform open surgery under general anesthesia via lateral rhinotomy and medial maxillectomy.\n",
            "Patient: Okay, let's do it.\n",
            "*After surgery*\n",
            "Doctor: The surgery went well. The maxillary sinus mucosa was completely replaced by inflammatory tissue, which we were able to mobilize and dissect free from surrounding tissues within the orbit and pterygopalatine fossa. There was no macroscopic invasion of any neighboring structures. The histopathological examination revealed typical nasal polyposis with a mixed population of eosinophils, neutrophils, and macrophages, and no evidence of fungal invasion.\n",
            "Patient: What's the postoperative treatment?\n",
            "Doctor: We'll start you on antibiotic and corticosteroid treatment for a short period. You'll also use local nasal mometasone furoate for 2 months after surgery, and we'll administer intensive saline solution irrigations.\n",
            "Patient: If I follow this treatment, will my symptoms improve?\n",
            "Doctor: Yes, following this treatment plan should help alleviate your symptoms. Currently, there are no clinical/radiological signs or symptoms of further complications.
